Feature: FullTextSearchAwareEntity functionality
  FullTextSearchAwareEntity should correctly handle full-text search data and sorting criteria

  Scenario Outline: Initializing sort criteria based on search text
    Given a search filter with text "<searchText>"
    When sort criteria are initialized with page <pageNumber> and size <pageSize>
    Then the pageable should have page <pageNumber> and size <pageSize>
    And the pageable should sort by "<expectedSortField>" in "<expectedSortDirection>" direction
    Examples:
      | searchText   | pageNumber | pageSize | expectedSortField | expectedSortDirection |
      | search terms | 0          | 10       | _searchRank       | DESC                  |
      |              | 0          | 10       | createdDate       | DESC                  |
      | null         | 0          | 10       | createdDate       | DESC                  |
      | search terms | 1          | 20       | _searchRank       | DESC                  |

  Scenario: Initializing sort criteria with existing sort criteria not by search rank
    Given a search filter with text "search terms"
    And existing sort criteria by "lastModifiedDate" in "ASC" direction
    When sort criteria are initialized with page 0 and size 10
    Then the pageable should have page 0 and size 10
    And the pageable should sort by "lastModifiedDate" in "ASC" direction

  Scenario: Initializing sort criteria with existing sort criteria by search rank (DESC must be enforced)
    Given a search filter with text "search terms"
    And existing sort criteria by "_searchRank" in "ASC" direction
    When sort criteria are initialized with page 0 and size 10
    Then the pageable should have page 0 and size 10
    And the pageable should sort by "_searchRank" in "DESC" direction

  Scenario Outline: Assigning full-text search data
    Given a test entity with search data "<searchData>"
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the full-text search data should contain ngrams from "<searchData>"
    And the full-text search data length should not exceed the dialect maximum
    Examples:
      | searchData                                                                                                           |
      | simple search text                                                                                                   |
      | text with special characters: !@#$%^&*()                                                                             |
      | text with accented characters: áéíóú                                                                                 |
      | very long text that repeats many times very long text that repeats many times very long text that repeats many times |

  Scenario: Checksum prevents regeneration when search data hasn't changed
    Given a test entity with search data "initial search content"
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the search data checksum should be calculated and stored
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the full-text search data should not be regenerated
    And the search data checksum should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Checksum triggers regeneration when search data changes
    Given a test entity with search data "initial search content"
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the search data checksum should be calculated and stored
    When the entity search data is changed to "updated search content"
    And full-text search data is collected
    Then the full-text search data should be regenerated
    And the search data checksum should be updated

  Scenario: Checksum handles null search data correctly
    Given a test entity with search data "null"
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the search data checksum should represent empty content
    When the entity search data is changed to "some content"
    And full-text search data is collected
    Then the full-text search data should be regenerated
    And the search data checksum should be updated

  Scenario Outline: Checksum detects changes in individual search fields
    Given a test entity with multiple search fields:
      | field1   | field2   | field3   |
      | <field1> | <field2> | <field3> |
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the search data checksum should be calculated and stored
    When the entity field "<changedField>" is changed to "<newValue>"
    And full-text search data is collected
    Then the full-text search data should be regenerated
    And the search data checksum should be updated
    Examples:
      | field1      | field2      | field3        | changedField | newValue          |
      | content one | content two | content three | field1       | new content one   |
      | content one | content two | content three | field2       | new content two   |
      | content one | content two | content three | field3       | new content three |

  Scenario: Checksum performance for large text content
    Given a test entity with large search data of size 10000 characters
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the search data checksum should be calculated in less than 500 milliseconds
    When full-text search data is collected
    Then the full-text search data generation should be skipped
    And the operation should complete in less than 100 milliseconds

  Scenario Outline: Testing createFullTextSearchChunks with edge cases
    Given a test entity with search data "<searchData>"
    When full-text search chunks are created
    Then the chunks should be valid and contain "<expectedContent>" if present
    And no chunks should contain SQL injection characters
    Examples:
      | searchData                                          | expectedContent                                          |
      | null                                                |                                                          |
      |                                                     |                                                          |

  # Supplier tokens:

  #   'null'        - null supplier entry
  #   'null-value'  - supplier returning null
  #   'blank'       - empty string
  #   'space'/'tab'/'newline' - whitespace-only values
  #   'large-text'  - ~12 KB of mixed Cyrillic and ASCII
  # Joined-text tokens:
  #   'empty'       - empty string
  #   'large-text'
  Scenario Outline: Streaming checksum is byte-identical to computeJsonChecksum of the joined supplier text
    Given a configurable test entity with search data suppliers "<suppliers>"
    When the configurable entity rebuilds its full-text search ngrams
    Then the search data checksum should equal the checksum of "<joinedText>"
    Examples:
      | caseName                     | suppliers                        | joinedText            |

      | single value                 | hello                            | hello                 |

      | blanks interleaved           | blank;one;space;two;null;three   | one two three         |
      | values with inner spaces     | two words;more words             | two words more words  |
      | cyrillic values              | Привет;мир                       | Привет мир            |

      | large mixed-script text      | large-text                       | large-text            |

  Scenario: Unchanged content skips the ngram rebuild
    Given a configurable test entity with search data suppliers "initial search content"
    When the configurable entity rebuilds its full-text search ngrams
    Then the rebuilt full-text search data should not be blank
    When the full-text search data is manually set to "sentinel-not-rebuilt"
    And the configurable entity rebuilds its full-text search ngrams
    Then the full-text search data should remain "sentinel-not-rebuilt"
    And the search data checksum should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Changed content rebuilds the ngrams and stores the new streaming checksum
    Given a configurable test entity with a mutable search data supplier initially returning "initial search content"
    When the configurable entity rebuilds its full-text search ngrams
    Then the rebuilt full-text search data should not be blank
    When the mutable search data supplier is changed to return "updated search content"
    And the configurable entity rebuilds its full-text search ngrams
    Then the full-text search data should be regenerated on the configurable entity
    And the search data checksum should not equal the checksum of "initial search content"
    And the search data checksum should equal the checksum of "updated search content"
