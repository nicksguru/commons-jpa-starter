/**
 * Generates UUIDv4 which is simply a long random number. Its quality depends on the server's random generator. It's not
 * time-sortable which is an advantage for exposing such UUIDs to the public safely. For purely internal data, consider
 * using {@link UuidV7CrockfordBase32Generator} because it has a better DB index locality.
 * <p>
 * The UUID is encoded with Crockford Base32, which yields 26 characters (decimal digits and lowercase letters). Just to
 * compare, Base64 encoding yields 22 characters (not a big difference), but they are case-sensitive and may cause
 * issues related to DB column case-sensitiveness. The default hex encoding is 36 characters long.
 * <p>
 * When called for an object already having a non-null ID, does nothing.
